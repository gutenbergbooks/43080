<h1>DEVOTA</h1>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A telegram</span>, Madam. The
messenger waits for an answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The butler held out a silver salver,
and Mrs. Rexford Churchill laid aside
her embroidery and took the ominous
yellow envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">Glancing over the contents, her face
brightened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No answer, Ramsay. Tell Hansel
to take the dog-cart to the station in
ample time to meet the 5.42 train, as
Miss Lindsay is coming. The trap and
victoria are in the hands of the fishing
party who may be late returning home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The hostess turned toward her companion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
an elderly woman whose white
hair was partly covered by a lace cap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is certainly a charming surprise,
and will be as welcome to you and
the Bishop as it is to me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen, Mrs. Roscoe:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I sail on Saturday. Decided suddenly
to run up for a night only to say
good-bye. Expect me by 5.42 express.
If bungalow is crowded put cot in
nursery. Must return on 8.20 train
to-morrow morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="author">&#39;<span class="smcap">Devota Lindsay</span>.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I planned this house party
she promised to join us, but afterward
wrote cancelling the engagement, which
she said she could not keep because her
uncle insisted on sailing abroad earlier
than she had anticipated. Only three
days ago I received farewell notes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
a box of souvenirs for my children who
simply worship her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you an old friend of Miss
Lindsay?&quot; asked the Bishop&#39;s wife,
peering over the top of her gold-rimmed
glasses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I made her acquaintance about three
years ago&mdash;under circumstances that
proved her an angel of mercy to me
and mine. While in Switzerland, my
husband was called home on urgent
business, leaving us to follow him a
few weeks later. Two days after we
sailed, a frightful storm set in, and I
and my elder children were so sea-sick
we could not hold up our heads, even
when my baby boy developed malignant
diphtheria. His nurse deserted
us, fellow passengers shunned us as if
we were lepers, and only the steamer&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
surgeon ventured to assist in caring for
the stricken child. Then Miss Lindsay,
though a total stranger, came to the
rescue&mdash;gave up her stateroom to my
two children, Grace and Otto, whom
she placed in charge of her maid, an admirable
woman of middle age, and,
though we had never met before, Miss
Lindsay shared my room and nursed
my baby day and night. We were three
days overdue, and when my husband
met us at the pier, he carried the older
children to their grandmother, but that
dear, blessed girl, Devota Lindsay,
went with me to the isolated ward of an
infirmary, and remained until my poor
little one was pronounced well. Do you
wonder we have all lifted her to a pedestal
as high as the court-house clock
tower?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
&quot;Probably your great intimacy with
Miss Lindsay enables you to fully understand
her character, which seems to
most of us an enigma.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear madam, an attempt at intimacy
with her would prove as satisfactory
and responsive as a flirtation
with the Sphinx. Dearly as I love, and
warmly as I admire her, I should never
presume to intrude on personal matters.
Her beauty and gracious magnetism
draw one very close, yet I am always
conscious that some invisible bar is
never let down, and that impalpable
barrier hedges her from curious questioning.
She is the only woman I know
who absolutely declines personal confidences,
abhors gossip, and never talks
about herself. One afternoon at a
&#39;reception,&#39; where a scandalous record
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
was severely criticised by an intimate
associate of the indiscreet lady under
fire, I heard Miss Lindsay say: &#39;That
shrewd cynic&#39;s advice was wise, &quot;Live
with your friends remembering they
may one day be your enemies.&quot;&#39;
She certainly accepts his rule of conduct.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has refused so many conspicuously
eligible offers, that no one believes
she will ever marry, and it surely is regrettable
that her great fortune should
not be consecrated to Christian philanthropy.
Dr. Bevan, her rector, dined
with us recently, and he and the Bishop
deplored her complete indifference to
church work. Dr. Bevan said he had
made her president of the &#39;Charity
Guild,&#39; and when he called to urge upon
her, acceptance of the responsible position
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
that involved an individual investigation
of needy sufferers, she
waved him off, exclaiming: &#39;Slumming!
Please be so kind as to excuse
me from that variety of church picnic,
of Guild outing. Assess me as you
think proper, or as the charity needs
demand, but &quot;slumming&quot; includes
draggled skirts, and soiled, defaced
ideals; and no laundries exist for the
purification and repairing of besmirched
ideals.&#39; She seems utterly
incapable of any spiritual exaltation,
and her rector assured us she paid
promptly her church and charity dues
just as perfunctorily as her real
estate taxes, and her insurance policies&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dr. Bevan appears to have forgotten
the costly new reredos she erected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
for us in St. Luke&#39;s,&quot; interrupted Mrs.
Churchill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all, my dear, but he deplores
the fact that she gave it with no more
enthusiasm than she would have shown
in ordering a new roof, or a plate glass
front for one of her office buildings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fancy gushing enthusiasm in
Miss Lindsay would surprise us quite
as much as a lava flow on the Jungfrau.
This is the era of sensational fads and
whimsies, and of spectacular philanthropic
feats, but I believe my noble
friend fondles no pet &#39;mission,&#39; has no
fetich&mdash;unless it be the splendid pipe
organ in her music room, or my own
young barbarian Rex, whose life she
saved by careful nursing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course you know her family history
is rather peculiar.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
&quot;She has never referred to it, but
social gossip always traces outlines as
regards millionaires&#39; domestic laundries.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The facts are well known to a few
persons. Hugh Lindsay, this woman&#39;s
father, was a remarkably handsome,
dashing young man with barely money
enough to pay his tailor and board bills,
when a rich college chum carried him in
his yacht to England. There he met
Lady Shirley &mdash;&mdash;, who had been betrothed
by her father and mother to an
elderly, gouty, widowed earl, with the
expectation that a marriage settlement
would enable her parents to reclaim a
certain estate that was heavily encumbered.
The girl was young and headstrong,
infatuated with Hugh Lindsay,
and one day at Monte Carlo, while her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
parents were in the casino, Lady Shirley
met Lindsay, whose friend&#39;s yacht
was lying off Monaco, and she ran
away with the impecunious, good-looking
young athlete. An American
clergyman went with them to the front
of the Church of Ste. Devota, and married
them there&mdash;while the January festival
procession in honor of the saint
thronged the church. That explains
the singular misnomer of your friend&#39;s
baptismal label&mdash;Devota. The soul of
the girl martyr, whose burial was dove
conducted, was supposed to hover in
benediction over the nuptial ceremony,
hence the only child of this marriage
was christened Devota. Ludicrously
inappropriate for a character devoid of
spirituality! Very naturally the bride&#39;s
family disowned so disobedient a child,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
and the young couple soon confronted
poverty. Lindsay went manfully to
work as clerk in a law office, and they
lived humbly and quietly for nearly
two years, when lo! his brother Ormond
died suddenly, leaving an enormous
fortune in gold, silver and copper mines
located in a western territory. Ormond
was a bachelor, an adventurous prospector
in regions where a great railroad
was only partly finished, and as he left
no other heirs his vast estate was divided
between Hugh and another brother,
Hollis Lindsay, giving millions to each.
Then began social exploitation and
&#39;yellow journal&#39; comments on &#39;princely
expenditures&#39; for town and country
houses, yachts, etc., etc., all kept up on
lavish lines of strictly English methods.
Mrs. Lindsay&#39;s titled parents suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
remembered her existence, and made
cordial overtures for a reconciliation,
which were spurned by the resentful
daughter who refused even an amicable
correspondence. She was an extremely
beautiful and haughty woman, but most
devotedly attached to her handsome,
loyal husband, and he never recovered
from the shock of her death. They
were returning from a ride, and on the
stone drive-way near the front door,
their only child Devota, about five years
old, was romping with her dog. Suddenly
she darted from behind a clump
of dense shrubbery, and as her white
skirts fluttered, Mrs. Lindsay&#39;s horse
shied, reared and threw her to the
ground, killing her instantly. Hugh
Lindsay became a morose, morbid recluse,
avoiding the sight of his poor, innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
child whom he regarded as the
cause of his wife&#39;s tragic death. Three
years later he died, leaving Devota to
the guardianship of his brother Hollis,
who at once shut up the houses, sold
yacht, horses and hounds, and placed
his niece in the hands of an old maid
aunt, sister of his mother. She lived in
a small town in a distant part of this
State near the mountains. Devota was
kept there in comparative seclusion,
trained by governesses and tutors until
she was about eighteen; then Hollis
took her abroad, and as he has long been
a globe-trotting &#39;scientist&#39;&mdash;heaven
save the mark!&mdash;the girl was dragged
hither and yon among byways and jungles,
and only God knows what heathen
holes. Hollis Lindsay has no more religion
than the Java &quot;pithecanthropus&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
he declares is the biological Adam, and
which he accepts as his own ancestor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is tenderly attached to her
uncle, and, Mrs. Roscoe, I heard your
husband say Hollis Lindsay ranked
high as a scholar and scientist,&quot; ventured
Mrs. Churchill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, more&#39;s the pity. Do you
know what he has the effrontery to
assert as proof of his &#39;monism&#39; sophistries?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Churchill bit her lip to restrain
a laugh, and bent over her embroidery
hoop.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; and bless my poor ignorant
soul, you must excuse me if I confess
that I don&#39;t much care; because we
women never understand tiresome
wrangles over fossil bugs, snakes and
beasts that were kind and decent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
enough to crawl into the earth and become
extinct before they had a chance
to worry us. The agreeable fact that
appeals to my sympathy is that Mr.
Lindsay is an extraordinarily handsome
man, a delightful talker, and
most charming host.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As head of a Christian household,
you will at least admit that it is part
of your duty to guard the sanctity of
Bible records. Hollis Lindsay declares
Cain took for his wife &#39;a highly
developed female animal,&#39; of course a
beast; doubtless a monkey! Think of
such a man as suitable to guide the
training of a young woman! It is
monstrous that atheism should prowl
through the world, clothed in purple
and fine linen, panoplied with wealth
and fashionable influence&mdash;and sowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
poison at every step. Heresy is just as
contagious as smallpox&mdash;and vicious
environment produces depravity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Mrs. Roscoe, luckily there are
exceptions. Sometimes it happens that
&#39;breed is stronger than pasture.&#39; Romulus
and Remus were baser than beasts
if they had not dearly loved and toddled
after their four-footed foster mother,
yet no fable tells us they imbibed carnivorous
tastes or pranced around as
weir wolves. Last winter I met an
English gentleman in Washington who
told me something I should like to
verify. He admired Miss Lindsay immensely,
but he censured severely her
treatment of her grandmother in London.
Mrs. Roscoe, do you know the
circumstances?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I have the facts from the wife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
of our minister who presented Devota
at Court. It appears that Lady Shirley&#39;s
mother saw your friend on that
occasion, and so startling was the girl&#39;s
resemblance to her own lovely mother,
that the dowager grandmother almost
swooned at sight of her. Next day she
wrote a most affectionate note imploring
the young woman to come to her,
and sent her carriage and maid to the
hotel. The note was read and returned
with this cruelly curt response: &#39;I am
leaving London to-day. Permit me to
say that the recognition withheld from
my mother will never be accepted by
her child.&#39; Can you imagine the implacable,
rancorous revenge that could
so harshly reject overtures from an
aged, white-haired grandmother? That
girl has the wrought-iron will of Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
Shirley. Not long ago Horace Bingham
told my son that when it was reported
a young English nobleman&mdash;lacking
money to repair his Elizabethan
manor house&mdash;was trying to marry
Miss Lindsay, Horace asked her when
she would wear the ancestral diamonds
his lordship offered her, and she replied
icily: &#39;I do not buy my jewels from
titled peddlers.&#39; There! I hear the
Bishop coughing and he needs his lozenges.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the door closed behind Mrs. Roscoe,
her hostess laughed softly and
murmured:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear old, pre-sanctified cat!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">An exceedingly pretty woman, dowered
with a kind and sunny nature,
Mrs. Churchill was a devotedly tender
wife and mother, loyally attached to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
church, and undeniably fond of her card
club, opera box and gay house-parties&mdash;the
latter an unusually attractive feature
of summer sojourns at her villa,
&quot;The Oleanders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two hours later in the day, she sat
before the oval mirror of her dressing-room,
watching the nimble fingers of
the maid pile her black hair into a towering
pompadour, while Miss Lindsay
leaned back in an easy chair close to the
onyx toilet table.</p>

<p class="indent">Behind the blue crest of a distant
peak the sun had disappeared, but
the vivid light of afterglow streamed
through the open window framed in
riotous clusters of <i>réve d&#39;or</i> roses; and
beyond the eastern rock-bound shore
line stretched a breeze-dimpled yellow
sea, where sail boats swung like gigantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
white butterflies over a wind-swept
field of jonquils.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Churchill, where are the children?
As I must leave after an early
cup of coffee in the morning, I should
like to see as much as possible of them
this evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All gone to a dog show in the village,
and afterwards to a birthday tea
at the Whiteheads&#39;. I tried to buy off
Rex, and offered sundry bribes, as he is
rather too young yet; but he is such a
persistent, wilful little sinner, and besides,
the governess, seconded by Grace
and Otto, stood security for his good
behavior at the tea-party. There, Anice&mdash;my
head is sufficiently like the tower
of Babel! Get things ready for Miss
Lindsay and shake out her dinner
gown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
The maid fastened a diamond crescent
in her mistress&#39;s hair and withdrew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, why must you hurry away on
that first train?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Uncle Hollis wishes to read a paper
on the opening day of a congress in
Geneva, and any delay in our sailing
day after to-morrow would cancel his
engagement. So many matters remain
unfinished I decided only at the last
moment to run up for a night, and I
very much doubt the wisdom of coming
at all.&quot; She rose, closed the door
of the dressing-room and resumed her
seat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Devota, how wonderfully well
you look! Each year seems to add to
your fresh loveliness and you appear
younger than when I first saw you.
Tell a needy friend how you manage to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
placate wrinkling, sallowing, greying
time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My health is perfect; my hair and
teeth remain very loyal, and as I never
insulted my complexion by any attempts
to improve it, there seems no
grievance for it to redress. With
thanks for your friendly compliments
let us dismiss my personality. Now, I
owe you an explanation which your
clock warns me must be brief. I am
sure you will not doubt my sincere desire
to see you all before going abroad&mdash;even
when I tell you that a very different
motive compelled this visit. I
came here especially to see Governor
Armitage, who, I am told, is still your
guest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he remains with us until Saturday;
but you knew he would belong to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
this house-party, for it was after I sent
you a revised list of friends who had
accepted, that you suddenly declined
joining us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At that time there existed no reason
for any wish to meet him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it possible you have never seen
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have seen him several times; once
or twice at the opera he sat quite near
my box&mdash;but I have not even a bowing
acquaintance with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have not been to the State
Capitol?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not during his incumbency. You
know all the horrible conditions that
surround our unfortunate friend Amy
Clinton. The date of her husband&#39;s
execution is only five days distant, and
every effort to delay it or secure a pardon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
has failed. Poor Amy&#39;s baby is
critically ill, and old Mrs. Clinton is so
prostrated since her unsuccessful journey
to the Governor, in her son&#39;s behalf,
that neither she nor the wife can
make a farewell visit to the prison.
This morning an urgent message over
the telephone called me to the Clinton
home, where I found Amy frantic with
grief and dread. She showed me a telegram
from her husband: &#39;I have no
hope. Chaplain says only one last
chance; insists you send Devota Lindsay
to Governor. She may save me.
For God&#39;s sake get her help.&#39; Can you
imagine my painful perplexity? Amy
could not give any reason for the chaplain&#39;s
belief&mdash;she said he was a new
man in the prison work and she could
not recall his name. I tried to convince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
her it was utterly impossible that I
could succeed where vastly more powerful
influences had repeatedly failed;
but in her frenzied condition she listened
to no refusal. Knowing the hopelessness
of the attempt, I resisted all
appeals until she lifted her gasping
baby close to my face, and almost
screamed: &#39;Can you die in peace if you
refuse to try to save my darling&#39;s father
from the gallows? Will you see her in
her coffin disgraced because you would
not lift a finger?&#39; So I am here, on a
fool&#39;s errand, confronting humiliating
defeat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Churchill&#39;s eyes were full of
tears, and leaning forward she softly
stroked Devota&#39;s beautiful hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my dear&mdash;what a frightful ordeal
for you! I would encourage you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
if I dared, but while the Governor is
bland as May sunshine he is simply inexorable
when once he decides a matter.
Feminine wiles and feminine wails
make no more impression on him than
summer dew on an iron-clad; and his
cool, smiling way of shieing at every
suggestion of marriage makes me absolutely
sure that some pretty, vixenish
kitten of a girl has clawed and frazzled
his heart strings. How I wish I could
help you! Poor Amy&mdash;it is heart-breaking
to think of her awful fate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can help me by man&oelig;uvring
to secure an opportunity for a brief
presentation of Amy&#39;s appeal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Churchill clasped and unclasped
a jewelled serpent at her wrist, and her
brows contracted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That could easily be accomplished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
by his taking you in to dinner, but unluckily
I am handicapped by the Bishop&#39;s
wife who arrived only this morning
and has precedence. Oh, the eternal
unfitness of ecclesiastical ingredients in
secular pie!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very glad he escorts Mrs.
Roscoe, because I could not possibly
broach my distressing business in the
presence of a chattering dinner party,
and I must obtain a private interview.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have arranged to consign you during
dinner, to the tender mercies of
your avowed naval worshipper, Captain
Winstead, who is spending the week
with his mother, and comes to us for
this evening. The Governor and his
secretary have exclusive use of the library,
and sometimes they are shut up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
there after dinner. We can watch his
movements, and you must storm the
citadel and expel Mr. Walton who lives
at his typewriter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the paved driveway beneath the
window sounded the beating of horses&#39;
hoofs, and a man&#39;s deep, mellow voice
saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry I cannot yield to your
wishes, and, my dear Churchill, you
should remember that you once gave
me an agate seal inscribed&mdash;&#39;<i>J&#39;y suis,
j&#39;y reste</i>.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Devota shivered and rose. Mrs.
Churchill caught her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those two have just returned from
their daily horseback ride, when, secure
from eavesdroppers, they discuss State
politics. Did you hear, &#39;<i>J&#39;y suis, j&#39;y
reste</i>?&#39; He lives that historic motto!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
My husband thinks him the noblest man
on earth, despite the fact that as an
attorney for various classes, Rexford
prepares bills that the Governor sometimes
fights stubbornly. A great many
years ago, before his political career
began, when he was almost obscure, a
horrid scandal was hatched against
Royal Armitage, who it seems held
some professional secret, and rather
than betray the real sinner he kept silence,
and endured disgrace until an
unexpected death-bed confession fully
cleared his character; and since then the
people in that part of the State have
never been able to do enough for him.
This is his second term. Now run away
and get ready for battle. You must
look your best to-night and have barely
time to dress. By the by, speaking of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
deadly battles, wait a minute. Do you
mind telling me why and how you dared
to cross swords with my august and
formidable cousin, who has half the alphabet
in capital letters dangling like a
kite&#39;s ragged tail after her name, Professor
Hannah Barbara Brown?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Lindsay had reached the door,
but paused and looked back over her
shoulder:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As president of her college she
wished me to endow a chair of Philology
and Etymology; and to convince
me of the absolute necessity of &#39;broader
lines&#39; of culture in education of girls,
she commented on the surprising ignorance
of some women who do not
know that the abusive word &#39;virago&#39;
was a valued title of intellectual honor
in the fifteenth century, and that its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
twin horror &#39;termagant&#39; originally
designated a deity. In very respectful
terms I declined her scheme, on the
ground that the new dictatorship of big
wigs in orthography&mdash;the prophets of
revised language&mdash;would soon leave no
etymon for students to hunt down;
&#39;fonetik refawm&#39; would end that scholarly
game. I tried in vain to propitiate
her by offering to provide a chair of
&#39;Household Economics, Sanitation and
Decoration&#39;; but she deluged me with
vitriolic sarcasm, and in closing the correspondence,
I ventured to quote a
crusty old critic: &#39;If the stockings are
blue, the petticoat must be long.&#39;&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> a master painter, crowned
with international renown, had
unsuccessfully attempted a
portrait of Devota Lindsay, he turned
the canvas head down with face to
the wall, and vented his irrepressible
chagrin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Lindsay will pardon me for
declining to waste any longer her patience,
and my time in finishing a picture
that can be merely a pretty mask.
Despite its classic lines and exquisite
coloring the locked face you show me,
no more reflects your individual mentality
and emotional potentialities than
some flawless alabaster mask. If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
will permit a frank analysis, I should
say your habitual expression is that of
complete, well-trained repose, impervious
to shocks; and even your eyes&mdash;if
windows of your soul&mdash;are deftly
curtained with a radiant mist defying
scrutiny. If you will excuse the <i>argot</i>
of your own countrymen, should the
day ever arrive when you &#39;let yourself
go,&#39; may I be there to paint the real
woman! I shall destroy this baffling
work, retaining only the hand and arm,
which you must grant me as some solace
for defeat. The day is not distant when
you will recognize your wrist and fingers
in my &#39;Egeria&#39; signalling Numa.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mature womanhood very rarely preserves
the fresh and dainty tints peculiar
to girlish youth, and to-night as
Miss Lindsay walked slowly down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
stairs, one might well have doubted the
number of years that had rolled so tenderly,
leaving no credentials to line
their passage.</p>

<p class="indent">Her dinner dress of heliotrope chiffon
was cut square at the neck, garnished
with filmy Mechlin, and around
her throat she wore a broad collar composed
of three rows of large fire opals,
set in delicate Venetian network of gold
wire, from the center of which hung a
Maltese cross of diamonds. In her silk
girdle was fastened a bunch of long-stemmed
double white violets. The
slender handle of her circular fan was
studded with opals, and the disk glowed
with its iridescent border of peacock
feathers.</p>

<p class="indent">Avoiding the main door of the long
parlor whence came the hum and chatter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
of many voices, she paused in an
adjoining music-room, where a lace-curtained
arch-way permitted a view of
the assembled guests. Above the arch
an electric light glared over her face
and figure, enhancing the golden shimmer
of her hair, and the starry brilliance
of the long-lashed velvety hazel
eyes. Cautiously lifting the outside
edge of the drapery, she looked at the
various groups, and her gaze fastened
on one where the hostess, the Bishop&#39;s
wife, and Mrs. Van Allen&mdash;a gay young
widow&mdash;clustered around the tall, athletic
form of Governor Royal Armitage.</p>

<p class="indent">At forty-three years of age he
looked older; his massive, finely modelled
head and very regular features
justified the generally conceded epithet
&quot;handsome&quot;; yet in repose his face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
was cold, and the sombre, dark grey
eyes rarely changed their brooding, <i>en
garde</i> expression, even when the well-cut
lips parted in a smile that disclosed
a superb set of teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">Devota studied the countenance for
a moment, and crushed back a half-uttered
moan, while a tremor shook her;
then lifted the lace curtain and entered
the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Miss Lindsay, how welcome
you are after we had abandoned all
hope of this pleasure! Following my
example, our entire household wept
over your failure to come sooner. My
wife tells me you know everybody here
except the Governor, and since you are
strangers, I am glad it is my privilege
to make you both my debtor by an introduction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
Mr. Churchill drew her hand to his
arm, and she bowed to right and left to
guests, as the host led her forward.
The Governor was bending over an
engraving in Mrs. Roscoe&#39;s hand, but
suddenly drew himself erect and threw
his head back proudly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gov&#39; Armitage, I am exceedingly
glad to present you to Miss Lindsay,
our family mascot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both bowed impressively, and a deep,
well-trained, manly voice answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I assure you it is a pleasant surprise
to find myself numbered among those
so fortunate as to claim Miss Lindsay&#39;s
acquaintance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The cold grey eyes looked steadily
at Devota, but his face evinced no more
pleasure than the granite gargoyle on
the roof.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
&quot;It is my privilege to remember that
a great many years ago, when quite
young, I met your Excellency, but certainly
I have no right to expect that
after the long lapse of time any recognition
could occur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are very gracious to recall a
casual incident of &#39;auld lang syne&#39;
that I dared not flatter myself you
cared to remember; but that you have
not entirely forgotten it is as unexpected
as it is complimentary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The eyes of each probed deep, but
neither flinched, and as Mrs. Churchill
arched her brows and pinched her husband&#39;s
arm, Devota smiled, and turning
away held out her hand to Bishop
Roscoe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Miss Lindsay, I am glad
to have an opportunity to wish you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
Godspeed on the long tour you contemplate.
When do you sail?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At dawn, day after to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Churchill&#39;s fan tapped the
Bishop&#39;s wrist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is your duty to lecture her
soundly on her descent into the Bohemian
ranks of roaming &#39;bachelor girls,&#39;
who, running after tinsel kites they call
&#39;careers,&#39; turn their backs on all home
duties, forsake every form of genuine
feminine domesticity, cast family ties
to the winds and herd in tenements,
boat-houses and mountain camps. Professional
female tramps!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very sure he will agree with
me in thinking that Mrs. Churchill is
cruel in smothering her innocent friend
under an avalanche of opprobrious epithets.
My sole &#39;family tie&#39; happens to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
be Uncle Hollis, and I hold fast to him,
though to do so necessitates surrender
of &#39;home duties&#39; in order to keep under
his protecting wing. Not at all a
&#39;bachelor girl&#39; if you please; but having
recently bidden a reluctant and tearful
adieu to my thirty-first birthday, I
have deliberately selected a very different
and more subdued type of serene
old-maidhood&mdash;the effete and much-derided
spinster of less degenerate
days, a hundred years ago-who studied
Mrs. Chapone and Mrs. Opie, spent
all tender affections on pugs, canaries
and knitting needles, sternly confined
hilarity within the prim boundary of the
minuet, and revered chaperons almost
as devoutly as the &#39;Apostles&#39; Creed.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The announcement of dinner rearranged
the groups, and escorted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
Captain Winstead, Devota was seated
at an unusually large circular table
where sixteen persons found ample
room. There were no candelabra so
suggestive of childish &quot;peek-a-boo&quot;
or the tinsel frippery of Christmas
trees, and the colored tapers of juvenile
birthday fêtes; but from the ceiling a
flood of light fell from clustered electric
globes upon glass, silver and the
snowy damask cloth, wherein woven
wreathes of orchids seemed to stand out
as though embroidered in satin tissues.
Neither tall vase nor <i>bonbonnière</i> impeded
view of the entire table, and in
the center a long, low silver shell was
filled with stephanotis and amber-edged
Farleyense fronds, while in front of
each guest lay a slender spray of
daphne starred with bloom.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
Mrs, Churchill sat between the Governor,
assigned to Mrs. Roscoe, and the
Bishop, whose next neighbor was the
vivacious young widow Mrs. Van Allen,
a recent donor to his favorite
church of an old and very costly silver
sacrament service that Cellini was said
to have embossed and engraved.</p>

<p class="indent">Gradually the overture of general
chatter diminished, and as conversation
became dialogues between individual
couples, Devota found it difficult to
fix her attention upon Captain Winstead&#39;s
remarks, to which her replies
were brief and perfunctory. Notwithstanding
her efforts to resist the impulse,
her eyes turned often to the
smiling face of the man immediately
opposite her, and she was aware that
he studiously avoided looking at her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
He was an amused listener during
the progress of a spirited skirmish between
the hostess and Mrs. Roscoe on
the subject of &quot;bridge,&quot; which the latter
denounced as &quot;social gambling leprosy,&quot;
that was swiftly bringing the
morals of Monte Carlo into family circles,
and all phases of club life. Apparently
claiming victory in the argument,
the Bishop&#39;s aggressive wife next
opened fire on the Governor, because of
his failure to approve a bill framed to
secure a large appropriation for establishment
of an additional State reformatory.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is hard to believe that you, sir,
could turn a deaf ear to the cry for help
that calls to you from the criminal outcast
children, whose salvation should be
your dearest aim. An enemy of reformatories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
at the head of our State
government is surely a mournful and
disheartening spectacle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, my dear madam, your indictment
is so severe, you force me to
plead &#39;not guilty.&#39; For a thorough,
efficacious reformatory system I am
an earnest advocate, but my convictions
relative to desirable methods and conditions
may not meet your entire approval.
When I was vested with necessary
authority I made an exhaustive
inspection of all State penal and reform
institutions, and found an ample
reformatory centrally located and well
equipped along educational and industrial
lines. Regarding it as a vital
question, I have very carefully studied
reports of various farms, schools, etc.,
from the days of Pourtalès&#39; tragic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
failure, and I trust you will pardon me
if I frankly confess that statistics of
juvenile criminology do not encourage
me to increase the number of State reformatories.
The urgent need of reform
is too appalling to be ignored, but
the facts at my command do not warrant
a belief that herding youthful
offenders at State compounds or similar
institutions accomplishes the desired
result. A profound and noble student
of mankind admonishes us: &#39;Children
have more need of models than of
critics.&#39; Of course incurable moral degenerates
must be denied opportunity
to prey upon their fellow-creatures,
and for this sad class, provision for
seclusion is sufficient; but the &#39;cry of
the children&#39; now ringing through
our land is for parental guardianship&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
the return of domestic control.
Madam, the best, the divinely appointed
reformatories are preventive
as well as corrective, and God commissioned
one in every parent to whom
He intrusted an immortal soul for
mental and moral training. No outflow
rises higher than its source; as are
the family standards, usage and influence,
such inevitably must be the trend
of the nation&mdash;the vast aggregation of
those practically orphaned as regards
parental authority and guardianship.
We are all glad to remember distinguished
exceptions to prevailing conditions,
but how little genuine home life
remains to leaven the social masses?
Do fathers and mothers fully realize
that they have abdicated their throne
on the hearthstone, now usurped by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
servants and tutors, and that some day
the souls of their neglected sons and
daughters will be lost through their
failure to exert proper care, and watchful
guardianship? As I walk the streets
of our cities the terrible truth becomes
evident that parents have gone out after
strange club-gods, and the pavements
are the real nurseries of our boys
and girls. America&#39;s most urgent
national need is the revival of home
life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In order to promote the system of
reform you advocate in opposition to
Mrs. Roscoe&#39;s darling scheme, has it
never occurred to you that it might be
wise to establish in the Executive Mansion
a model household, for the imitation
of our State where other experimental
stations of various character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
seem to be educational?&quot; asked Mrs.
Van Allen.</p>

<p class="indent">The Governor bowed and laughed as
he replied:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your rosy suggestion is so alluring
that my utter inability to adopt it fills
me with poignant regret. Instead
of spending the past ten or twelve
years in trying to hypnotize some sweet
woman into the belief that I was
worthy of her trust, I have unwisely
devoted my entire energies to other and
far less charming pursuits, until confirmed
old bachelorship now absolutely
bars the possibility of any change.
Rest assured no sour grapes mar my
vineyard, and the hopelessly unattainable
is always invested with additional
value. Knowing my defrauded bachelorhood
seems inevitably unalterable&mdash;are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
you not needlessly cruel in dangling
so tempting a pink sugar-plum
beyond my grasp?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear child, don&#39;t soil your pretty
fingers by stoning the prophets!&quot; said
the Bishop, patting the bare, plump
arm of his near neighbor. &quot;Armitage
is right. He has diagnosed the social
sarcoma that threatens our national
vitals. Instead of purifying and exalting
the moral code, the press, the
politicians, even some of the clergy are
ranting and howling Jeremiads over
&#39;cannibal trusts,&#39; and corrupt corporate
and individual fortunes, and lashing
Congress, State legislatures and
even the Judiciary to institute a crusade
of covetousness, to rob the rich
in order that labor may hold its hands
in idleness and batten on plunder. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
American twentieth-century recrudescence
of Jacquerie freebooters! Our
youth must be trained in early years by
parental precept and example to understand
and to hold sacred the legal line
of boundary between <i>meum et tuum</i>&mdash;and
to obey God&#39;s law, &#39;Thou shalt
not covet&mdash;anything that is thy neighbor&#39;s&#39;;
but will fathers and mothers
perform a duty that may save this
country from vicious wholesale spoliation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good heavens&mdash;my Right Reverend
friend!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Churchill,
&quot;Have you no pity for fathers who
must fly kites in stock exchange, and
play poker at clubs, and bet on ball
games? And where, oh, where, shall
mothers find time for &#39;bridge&#39; and golf,
vaudeville and bargain counters?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
Bishop Roscoe shook a sprig of
daphne at her smiling face, and looked
gravely into her twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If, as a privileged guest, I have
dared to violate conventional canons
that govern &#39;table talk,&#39; by obtruding
ethics which certainly do not contribute
curry, horse-radish and Tabasco to the
conversational menu, I claim in extenuation
of prandial heresy, the obvious
fact that such charming people as surround
me to-day are not always in
their pews, to receive and assimilate the
homiletic dose distributed once a week
at the ecclesiastical dispensary. Please
do not vote me a bore if&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just one moment of parenthesis,
Bishop,&quot; interrupted Mr. Churchill.
&quot;Possess your soul in patience. This
wild craze of greedy, omnivorous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
grudging &#39;Have Nots&#39; is no new phase
of that variety of original sin that
claims something for nothing. Don&#39;t
forget how long it has been since Thurlow&#39;s
snarl: &#39;Corporations have neither
a soul to lose, nor a body to kick.&#39;
Demagogues are persuading the disgruntled
of all classes that they are
now kicking the vile, corrupt body of
corporations, but an inevitable reaction
will be forced when it becomes evident
that the kicks are aimed at the cornerstone
of civic equity&mdash;the universal and
inalienable right of every human being
to the fruit of his labor, mental or
manual&mdash;whether that fruit be dividends
of the capitalists, or daily wages
of miners, blacksmiths and ploughmen.
This popular creed of wholesale
confiscation which teaches &#39;Love thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
neighbor&#39;s goods more than thy soul,&#39;
has reached its ultimatum in arranging
even pre-natal conditions whereby
all children shall be born equal&mdash;not
mentally, not morally; oh, no! simply
financially, in consequence of abolishing
the right of unlimited inheritance.
Don&#39;t worry. The wave is nearing its
crest, and when it ebbs it will suck out
as wreckage the political charlatans
that hope to float into office.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Winstead&#39;s handsome black
eyes sparkled mischievously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Party politics are as unsuitable
on this occasion as would be a shooting
jacket worn at a Court function;
but, Mrs. Churchill, I am sure
you will forgive me if I dare ask one
question: Is not your husband a Democrat?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
&quot;Captain, your state of serene single
blessedness is evidently the result of
fright engendered by cartoon fables
depicting the abject subjugation of
husbands, by emancipated wives. Dismiss
that termagant scarecrow, for
behold! my undaunted, conjugal Czar
speaks for himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I a Democrat? You very well
know I have always been one, and I
am still clinging with grim, dogged
fealty to the few precious fragments
of genuinely orthodox democracy, that
survive the blows of disloyal demagogic
platform carpenters who raided
recent national conventions. Americans
of all parties need to remember
that their first duty as citizens is allegiance
to individual convictions of the
morality of public policies, instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
the existing mischievous custom of servile
submission to the ukase of committee
and convention dictators. The time-honored
party name, Democracy, is disgraced
by the effort to make it mother
a mongrel brood of socialists, whose
wild antics and schemes of universal
confiscation would cause Thomas Jefferson
to gasp. If he could only leave
his grave long enough to make one
speech, he would stamp out the clubs
profaning his revered name, and
scourge the &#39;populistic&#39; leaders&mdash;now
strutting under the standard of his
stolen mantle&mdash;as Christ emptied the
polluted temple. The spectacle of the
so-called &#39;Democracy&#39; of to-day would
so sicken his wise, honest, sturdy soul
that, I verily believe, a spiritual somersault
would land him close to Metternich&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
axiom: &#39;All <i>for</i>, not <i>through</i>, the
people.&#39; The constitutional basic, and
virile principles of my dear old Party
will weather this dusty whirlwind of
popular delusion, stirred up by ravening
socialist wolves, cloaked in Jeffersonian
fleeces; and primitive, genuine,
untainted democracy must come to its
own once more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yours is a rosy view, Mr. Churchill,
but who will undo the mischief accomplished
by American demagogues who
are spurring the people into the pitch
and sulphur pit of rank, Godless communism?
What remedy will avail?
Not schools, not colleges, not universities
where athletics, &#39;higher criticism&#39;
and &#39;phonetic spelling&#39; absorb attention
to the exclusion of Christian ethics&mdash;now
thrown aside as obsolete as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
Ptolemaic system of astronomy. The
decadent tendency of our people to
habitually seek excitement and diversion
at public places of amusement, has
reduced the once attractive home to a
mere economic residential combination
of refectory, dormitory and station for
laundry delivery. Interest in the outside
world usurps domestic attachments,
loosens family ties and that interdependence
of the members of the
hearthstone circle, that once made
genuine, old-fashioned home life so
potent a factor in developing well-balanced,
wholesome character, both
individual and national. It seems to
me the dear old &#39;Home, Sweet
Home&#39; of other days is now sadly
transformed into the nest of <i>ennui</i>
and hysterical unrest, whence all must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
flee who determine to &#39;have a good
time&#39;&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Bishop&#39;s homily was cut short
by a sharp cry in the hall, the patter of
running steps,&mdash;and into the dining-room
darted a red-haired child of six
years, followed by a panting nurse,
flushed and trembling, who held in one
hand a discarded small slipper and silk
sock.</p>

<p class="indent">Tiptoeing on his bare foot, the boy
glanced swiftly around the circle, and
sped to the chair where Miss Lindsay
sat. With a gurgling laugh he threw
himself against her, and pushing her
chair slightly away from the table, she
put one arm around and drew him close
to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rex, go back with Bertha,&quot; said
his mother, beckoning to the discomfited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
nurse who approached the table.
Two little arms clung desperately, and
the large blue eyes brimmed with tears,
while a sweet, childish voice pleaded
quaveringly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, mamma, Miss &#39;Vota runs away
before breakfast, and I must stay with
her! I&#39;m so afraid of that awful sea&mdash;and
Jonah&#39;s whale and the Devil&#39;s
fish&mdash;and slimy, pollywog, wriggling
things that may catch her&mdash;and please,
mamma darling, you know she&#39;s just
my very onliest sweetheart!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Devota leaned forward, and with the
assistance of Captain Winstead lifted
the boy to her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Churchill, please let me keep
him. He comes in with the other
sweets, and I beg for him as my one
special <i>bonbon</i>. Be gracious to me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
will you not? I stand sponsor for his
being &#39;seen and not heard.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Churchill flushed, but instantly
the Bishop raised his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Governor, veto that maternal sentence
of banishment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Governor Armitage smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is the first time I have ever regretted
the limitations of my veto prerogative,
but in recognition of Rex&#39;s
indubitable taste in selection of his
&#39;onliest sweetheart,&#39; I ask the privilege
of signing Miss Lindsay&#39;s petition for
retention of her loyal lover.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A tender light shone in his eloquent
grey eyes, but they were fixed on the
pretty boy&#39;s ruddy locks, rather than
the golden head bending against his
long curls.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Churchill motioned to the nurse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
to withdraw, and her lips twitched as
she replied:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can your Excellency, and your
Reverence, magnanimously ignore the
vivid object lesson, so unexpectedly
illustrative of your lectures on neglected
parental discipline? My young
rebel would certainly prefer your inconsistent
leniency to my exacting domestic
code. In honor of your pet
theory&mdash;that, like other distinguished
doctrinaires, you both decline to practise&mdash;I
must ask you all to drink a
toast once offered by a cynical wit
when dining at a table, which was similarly
invaded by marauders from the
host&#39;s nursery. I propose to drink to
&#39;King Herod.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted her wine glass, but each
guest laid a hand over theirs, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
the midst of a chorus of protests the
butler approached the Governor and
held out a salver on which lay two
telegrams.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you please, sir, Mr. Walton says
he thinks, sir, you must see these at
once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pushing aside his untasted pink ice,
Governor Armitage took the yellow envelopes,
rose, bowed to his hostess, and
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon my unceremonious desertion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he walked away, Mr. Churchill
called to him:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come back to us for coffee and
cigars. We shall wait for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you; no. I will join you
later.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
As the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room,
Mrs. Churchill paused at the
foot of the stairway, where the sullen
nurse lingered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on, Bertha, and get Rex&#39;s bath
ready. Miss Lindsay will take him
with her, as she wishes to see Grace and
Otto.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Turning to Devota, whose arm encircled
the boy&#39;s shoulder, she looked
steadily at both.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Churchill, you must do me the
favor to set my fears at rest about Rex.
Promise me he shall have no reason to
regret that he proved himself my brave
and loyal lover. Recollect I encouraged
his rebellion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mother twined over one finger
a red silk curl, and shook her free hand
warningly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
&quot;You both deserve a sound, old-fashioned,
hearty spanking, and I
make no rash promises; but as the pair
of you seem equally culpable, I might
be embarrassed in administering justice.
Good night, Rex. No, naughty
boys cannot kiss their mothers. Don&#39;t
forget your prayers, you need them.
Now, Miss Devota, do not let my
pretty imps, my tawny cub triad keep
you too long. Perhaps Providence is
aiding your mission by calling the Governor
to the library. Better watch his
door from the side hall. Good luck to
you, dear, when you beard the lion!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A</span> promise having been exacted
that the &quot;triad&quot; should
accompany her to the early
railway train, Devota went swiftly
down a rear staircase to the side corridor
running in front of the library.
The door was open, and from the
threshold she looked in. The room
was well lighted; the typewriting machine
at rest, the desk covered with
official documents, and from a file
at one side a sheaf of telegrams
rustled as the air surged through the
window. The sole occupant of the
apartment was the secretary, Mr. Walton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
seated before a tray-laden table.
He had dined, and was dallying with a
gilded liqueur glass in which iced Chartreuse
sparkled like splintered emeralds.</p>

<p class="indent">Doubtless Governor Armitage was
the centre of attraction in the drawing-room,
and the auspicious moment had
passed beyond recall. A premonition
of defeat impaired her self-control,
and shrinking from observation, Devota
walked down the corridor to an
arched door, whence a flight of steps
led to the flower garden.</p>

<p class="indent">Avoiding the stone terrace in front,
where an electric globe shone, she
turned into a winding path bordered on
both sides with wheeled boxes filled with
tall pink oleanders in profuse bloom.
A mid-summer full moon lighted every
corner of the sloping lawn, bringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
into velvety relief the shadow vignettes
traced by leaf and vine across the
smoothly clipped grass, and adding a
silvery lustre to beds of lilies that lifted
their white lips to drink from Hersé&#39;s
cool, dripping palms.</p>

<p class="indent">Among Mr. Churchill&#39;s valued curios
he numbered a quaint sun dial of black
lava, fashioned ages ago in an Ægean
isle riven by volcanic throes.</p>

<p class="indent">The gnomon had been destroyed, and
erosion by time and storm partly erased
the Greek characters on the base, but
doubtless some pagan Le Nôtre once
deemed it an ornamental altar to the
great sun god. A prosaic new gardener
at &quot;The Oleanders&quot; found it
more useful as a mere pedestal, whereon
he had placed a terra cotta vase filled
with luxuriant nasturtiums that wove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
over the whole a fringe of scarlet and
orange.</p>

<p class="indent">Devota stood beside the dial, and silently
wrestled with emotions habitually
held in bondage by an iron
will. The night had grown very still;
only a faint breath of air now and
then pilfered and strewed the attar
of oleanders and lilies, and from
rock-ribbed shore rose the solemn,
monotonous ocean hymn, the immemorial
recessional chanted by shattered
waves.</p>

<p class="indent">An overwhelming sorrow seized and
shook the lonely woman standing by
the dial. She threw up her arms, as if
in mute appeal to some tragic fate,
and her fingers gripped and wrung
each other; then the clenched hands fell
upon the crown and garlands of nasturtiums,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
and she closed her eyes to
shut out torturing retrospective visions.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>An overwhelming sorrow seized and shook the lonely
woman by the dial</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The pungent smoke of a cigar suddenly
arrested her attention, and over
the sward slowly walked the Governor.
As he passed a drooping deodar he disappeared,
but a moment later a great
cluster of rose oleander smote his bared
black head, and he stood inhaling its
fragrance. His upturned face showed
unusual pallor, and an expression of
profound sadness that failed to soften
its dominant sombre sternness. An
audible sigh escaped him, and throwing
away his cigar he moved forward toward
the terrace.</p>

<p class="indent">The sight of the graceful figure immediately
in front of him was evidently
an unpleasant surprise, and for an instant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
he wavered, tempted to turn aside,
then advanced. When quite near he
bowed, and without pausing, would
have passed her, but she stepped at
once to meet him.</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice was steady, though
strained, and her words crisp and
measured:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Governor Armitage can grant
me a few moments in which to lay before
him a matter of importance to others, I
shall be glad for reasons that he will
readily understand are not personal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it is Miss Lindsay&#39;s wish, my
time and services are certainly at her
command.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The moon shone full on both faces,
and each had suddenly contracted and
hardened. The Governor threw back
his head and folded his arms behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
him; Devota&#39;s right hand clutched the
edge of the dial, and with her left she
drew from beneath the violets in her
girdle a slip of telegram paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Having twice refused to become
a member of Mrs. Churchill&#39;s house-party
for this week, I was much annoyed,
perplexed and pained when
most unexpectedly I found myself reluctantly
obliged to come here for a
few hours. In the midst of preparations
for my long absence, I was summoned
to a grief-stricken family whose
pitiable condition of abject misery and
terror no verbal picture can exaggerate.
My old friend, Mrs. Ronald Clinton, is
prostrated by sickness and sorrow, and
unable to leave the room where her baby
girl is critically ill, probably dying;
while in the same house the aged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
mother-in-law raving with brain fever
calls for the son who is sentenced to be
hung next week. Neither his wife nor
his mother can visit the distant prison
to say good-bye to the doomed man;
In her despair, Amy Clinton, having
exhausted all other means of saving
her husband, has seized the fatuous belief
that my prayer might possibly have
some effect. It was in vain that I refused
to come, assuring her that I was
the very last person to send as envoy
to your Excellency, who had declined
her own appeal when she knelt at your
feet. She persisted in her frantic
pleadings because of an inexplicable
telegram from Ronald Clinton, telling
her the prison chaplain was sure I
could secure help for him. On what
grounds he based this preposterous advice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
Amy was absolutely ignorant, as
neither of us can learn even the name
of the chaplain. Knowing the futility
of my mission, I yielded at last to her
frenzied prayers&mdash;I drank the cup of
bitter humiliation&mdash;and as my last sacrifice
on the altar of friendship for a
broken-hearted wife and mother, I surrendered
my self-respect, my womanly
pride. Read this message to the wife,
and then I feel assured you will realize
what a terrible ordeal has finally forced
me into your presence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She held the telegram toward him,
and taking the paper he read it carefully
more than once. Refolding it, he
bowed and returned it, but the locked
lips yielded no comment. She tore the
slip into shreds, and her hands trembled
as she asked:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
&quot;Can your Excellency imagine why
this mournful and mortifying task was
laid on my unwilling shoulders, by the
chaplain who is an utter stranger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked intently into her beautiful
eyes, and his voice lowered to a key of
icy sternness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Miss Lindsay desires the name
of the chaplain, I can gratify her wish.
Peyton Knox has recently officiated in
the prison chapel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A hot wave crimsoned her cheeks,
and she shrank as if from a blow, but
as the color ebbed, she drew herself
proudly to her full height.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As any other total stranger claiming
every citizen&#39;s right of petition, I
reluctantly intrude upon your leisure,
and I appeal to you as a man, as a gentleman,
as the highest official of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
State, to grant some mercy to a doomed
criminal. For humanity&#39;s sake&mdash;oh,
Governor Armitage, for the sake of
a ruined and helpless family, I ask&mdash;I
beg&mdash;that you will pardon Ronald Clinton
and save two women from insanity!
Be merciful; oh, be merciful, as every
Governor can be if he so wills.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He watched her steadily, and once
he drew a long, deep breath as if sorely
oppressed; but her anxiously searching
gaze discovered no relaxation. She
suddenly leaned forward, and her exquisitely
curved lips quivered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will not deny my prayer!
You will pardon Ronald?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly he shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Lindsay, I shall never pardon
him. At all costs I must be absolutely
just.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
&quot;You will not spare his life? when
your office empowers you to set him
free? You cruelly elect to order his
wife widowed, and his babes disgraced!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Should I forget the widow and fatherless
little ones of Norman Hewitt
whom Ronald Clinton deliberately and
brutally murdered? The wrongs of the
dead are too often buried with him,
and sickly sympathy&mdash;posing as philanthropic
Christian clemency&mdash;is lavished
on branded Cains set free to defy
human and divine law, and repeat
crimes that should have forfeited their
blackened lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Excellency&#39;s standard of
justice is more righteous than that of
Abel&#39;s God, Who instead of slaying
his murderer granted him long life in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
which to purify his guilty soul and
mend his ways!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Disclaiming any approach to irreverence,
permit me to remind you
that the experiment of pardon was not
repeated; and the severest penal code
ever compiled came directly from the
Divine lawgiver, whose chosen people
demanded &#39;a life for a life.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hanging poor Amy&#39;s husband
could not compensate Mrs. Hewitt for
the loss of hers. The exaction of blood
tax is a legal survival of savagery.
Justice is not the sole divine attribute&mdash;mercy
is coordinate. Try to remember
that Talmudic prayer of Jehovah:
&#39;Be it my will that my mercy
overpower my justice!&#39; As Governor,
the issue of life or death lies in the hollow
of your hand, and for the last time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
I beg of you not to listen to the barbarous
prompting of a cruel revenge.
Think of the awful responsibility of
hurling an unprepared soul into eternity.
Think of the blessed relief that
only you can give to tortured, despairing
human hearts who can look to no
one but you for succor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never pardoned a convicted
criminal, and I never will. I cannot
conscientiously exercise the &#39;gubernatorial
prerogative&#39; of riding roughshod
over the mature, deliberate verdict
of twelve sane, dispassionate men
empowered to sift all testimony, and
carefully guard for their guidance only
indubitable evidence. The sanctity of
jury verdicts has been so frequently
violated by reckless use of pardoning
power, that the value of blood-bought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
jury trial has dwindled into a mere
mockery, an arena for spectacular professional
jugglers. Ample legal machinery
has long been provided for the
rehearing and unbiased review of all
criminal cases, whenever new witnesses
or new and vital facts cast any doubt
on the wisdom or justice of judge and
jury. Courts of appeal and review
should have power to correct wrongs
that juries sometimes inflict upon the
innocent, but the preposterous assumption
of infallible prescience and &#39;altruistic
clemency&#39; by a President or a
Governor is an ideal aspiration that I
do not permit myself to indulge. This
popular form of annulling jury verdicts
is a fatal blow at the very foundation
of penal jurisprudence; and the
exasperating quibbles of subtle attorneys&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
systematically delayed execution
of verdicts and the too frequent
veto of death sentences&mdash;all contribute
to the deplorable increase of lynching.
Pardon my taxing your patience for
this enumeration of my reasons for
preferring to leave justice to competent
and unprejudiced courts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She threw out one hand with a repellent
gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Capital punishment is merely revengeful,
judicial murder, utterly futile
as a corrective method. Taking a
second human life avails nothing as
requital for the destruction of the first
victim. It is indefensible cruelty in an
age pluming itself on higher humanitarian
standards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Lindsay, legal punitive statutes
are not designed as retaliatory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
sacrifices to revenge, but as deterrents
to crime, simply because dread of
speedy retribution is the most powerful
motive that can restrain the criminal
masses. Maudlin sentimentality
that just now inveighs against execution
of judicial penal decrees, is a danger
signal that points to public degeneracy
in a people who regard mawkish
sympathy with culprits as an advanced
phase of civilization; and to whom the
condonation of crime is more humanitarian
than its extirpation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His slowly uttered words rang with
the measured precision of a sculptor&#39;s
chisel upon stone, and the inquisitorial
eyes, no longer sombre, now glowed as
they looked steadily into hers. For an
instant a spasm of keen pain shivered
the composure of her haughty face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
and her voice rose into a bitter, half-strangled
cry:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No mercy from you! I might as
well pray to that growling sea yonder,
watching hungrily for the next drowning
wretch. I knew mine was a fool&#39;s
errand, yet pity conquered repugnance,
and it seemed so incredible, so monstrous
that any man could coolly point
to the gallows as sole answer to the
heart-rending petition of an almost
frantic family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He pressed a hand over his brow,
pushed back the thick, close-cut black
hair, and after a moment he answered
in an altered tone of profound and tender
regret:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My fellow monster, the sea, is
spared after-pangs that are my portion.
Do you imagine that any argument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
could avail to change my convictions
of official duty, when in a fiery
ordeal I felt compelled to deny the wailing
wife who brought her pretty little
ones to cry in their father&#39;s behalf?
Try to realize what must have been the
feelings of a man not wholly petrified,
when he lifted from his office floor
the kneeling form of an aged, white-haired
woman who could only gasp between
sobs: &#39;As you hope for mercy
when your naked soul fronts God on
His judgment seat, spare my son&#39;s
life! Remember the mother who cradled
you in her arms&mdash;for her sake, for
God&#39;s sake, be merciful to me&mdash;save
my boy from the gallows.&#39; Miss Lindsay,
the terrible curse is that the wages
of sin are paid too often to the helpless
innocent. I could not pardon Ronald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
Clinton, whose crime was deliberately
planned murder, but learning of illness
in his family, I sent a telegram at four
o&#39;clock to-day staying the execution of
his sentence until restoration to health
permits his mother and wife to spend
a day with him in prison. Sometimes
when I long for rest, the vision of those
heart-broken women and two lovely
children clinging to my knees, robs me
of sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You spared him only long enough
to say good-bye to those who, if possible,
would die to save him! Is that
deemed a mercy&mdash;or refinement of
cruelty? Your telegram was sent at
four o&#39;clock? If news of the reprieve
had only arrived before I left my house,
this needless journey would have been
averted; I should have been spared this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
keen humiliation on the eve of quitting
a country I shall probably see no more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From a silvered sea rose the metrical
rippling of waves crooning a &quot;<i>berceuse</i>&quot;
to drowsy lands cradled by
foam-laced surf. For a moment silence
had followed the woman&#39;s words, and
in that brief pause Governor Armitage&#39;s
luminous, watchful eyes noted a
swift and subtle change. The face
whitened, hardened to its usual rigid
coldness; all trace of emotion vanished
as utterly as the light from an extinguished
lamp in some lovely transparent
globe, and the strained expression
of her unflinching eyes gave place to
one of baffling, inflexible quietude; the
habitual mask temporarily loosened,
was readjusted.</p>

<p class="indent">When she spoke her clear, even tone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
showed no hint of cadence that had
sunk it to passionate protest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In ending an interview intolerably
repugnant to my womanly instincts,
permit me to say that, although conspicuously
futile as regards the sole
object of this visit to Mrs. Churchill,
I shall avail myself of the unexpected
opportunity to offer you an apology
for the grievous wrong of which I
was once guilty. Simple justice demands
this admission, and in addition
I frankly express my pleasure in finding
that my judgment was wholly erroneous.
I tender sincere congratulations
that your vindication was so triumphant;
and I bid your Excellency
good-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As she turned away he threw out a
detaining hand.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
&quot;Understanding fully what such
gracious words cost you, I value
them correspondingly, and hope my
thanks will be as acceptable as
your apology. Will you pardon me
if I venture to ask, if you
had known that Peyton Knox was
the chaplain who dictated the prison
telegram, would your sympathy for
poor Clinton&#39;s family have sufficed
to bring you into my presence?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had regained sufficient faith
in my integrity to believe that in matters
involving conscientious scruples, I
should prove callous even to Miss Lindsay&#39;s
appeals?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The starry glint in his eyes brightened,
and a bitter smile curled his lips.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
She met his gaze with cool, proud calmness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The number of mangled offerings
Governor Armitage has long laid before
the pet fetich he labels &#39;Duty,&#39;
allows no margin for any one to doubt
that the sacrificial axe needs no whetting
for the next victim on the official
scaffold. That I was predestined to
defeat I knew as well before I came as
now, but the sanctity of one&#39;s motive
can sometimes nerve one to drain even
a loathsome draught.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Only a few feet of sward separated
them, and while she stood apparently
as devoid of emotion as the sun dial, he
knew from the quivering of the diamonds
in the cross, and the fiery flashes
of the opals rising and falling at her
throat that her heart throbbed fiercely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
&quot;Have you chanced to remember the
day of the month, and that it is also
the thirteenth annual anniversary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, the thirteenth. Barring all
superstition, which of course you scout,
how could this disagreeable meeting
have failed to be unlucky? It is true
I have passed my springtime, but decrepitude
has not yet attacked my memory,
and it warns me now that I have
unduly trespassed on your Excellency&#39;s
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She bowed, stooped to gather up the
train of heliotrope chiffon, and moved
in the direction of the house, but he
stepped before her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, Miss Lindsay. May
I ask why you refused to marry Hoyte
Kingdon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Refused to marry him? Can you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
think it possible any sane woman could
be so hopelessly fatuous as to decline
an offer of his hand, of his exalted position?
How incredible the suggestion
that an opportunity of marriage so brilliant
would not have been seized with
avidity, by even the most ambitious of
husband hunters!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hoyte told me of his persistent but
unsuccessful effort to win your affection.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A defiant gleam leaped into her eyes
as she stood at bay, and in the brilliant
moonlight the coil of opals around her
lovely neck seemed a writhing serpent
of flame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Though women are satirized as unworthy
custodians of their suitor&#39;s confidential
proposals, it appears that
manly friends have no compunction in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
violating the seal of secrecy. Why did
I fail to marry Hoyte Kingdon? Since
your Excellency indulges such sympathetic
solicitude in his behalf, it will
comfort you to know that I sometimes
share your wonder at my lack of wisdom
in ignoring a prize coveted by
many others. I respected Hoyte, admired
his handsome personality, his
very brilliant talent, his diplomatic career;
and certainly the position he occupied
as ambassador at Court was
alluring to my ambition and tempting
in various aspects. I liked him immensely,
and I wished very much to
love him, but despite my heroic efforts
I could not find him essential to my
happiness. Is it not unfortunate that
one cannot successfully whistle love to
come, as one signals to a terrier or a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
roaming canary? Since the days of
poor Psyche elusive love plays hide-and-seek
in devious and baffling ways.
Hoyte now has a beautiful and charming
wife who makes him supremely
happy and graces the conspicuous diplomatic
circle in which he has attained
the highest honors. We expect to spend
Christmas with Hoyte and his wife
after our return from Bangkok. I am
sure his guardian angel was alert when
he barred my heart against Ambassador
Kingdon&#39;s magnetism.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leaning forward, the Governor&#39;s
eyes seemed to search her soul, and his
voice thrilled like a viol&#39;s chord.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did no tender, regretful memory
hold fast the lock that refused to
yield?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant she put her hand upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
the jewelled collar to loosen some stricture
that caught her throat, but her tone
was firm, her eyes fixed on his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Governor Armitage ought to know
that women are not retrospective, that
like other butterflies the present suffices
and we flee from &#39;regret&#39; as the real
vampire that robs us of bloom and
is so detrimental to curves of beauty.
We shrink from dead years&mdash;spectre-peopled&mdash;as
one shuns midnight
prowls in a cemetery where graves
may suddenly yawn over fleshless horrors.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Across the chasm of thirteen years
you still prefer to make no signal of
reconciliation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Scourged by a sense of justice
quite as keen as your own, I have apologized
for a great wrong you once suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
at my hands. I owed you that
acknowledgment, and now the debt is
cancelled fully, and the ghost of that
one regret is eternally at rest since I
have the gratifying assurance that the
harsh misjudgment of an impulsive
girl had no power to spoil your life,
or retard your eminently successful
career.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Failure in love affairs can &#39;spoil&#39;
no lives of those who maintain consciousness
of moral rectitude, and a
justifiable self-respect; but occasionally
such keen disappointments prove beneficent
tonics in teaching a wise discrimination
between sham and reality,
shadow and substance. Sooner or later
men and probably women learn that
the only human tie that even death cannot
dissolve, the one reliable chain that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
no treacherous weak link can impair&mdash;is
that binding the mother&#39;s heart to
her child. In desperately bitter trials
mother-love is the strengthening angel
that sustains, and when the world
turned its back upon me, my blessed
mother was my sole solace and defender.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because knowing something of the
truth she could not doubt. To her at
least you had given facts withheld even
from&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me. She was as absolutely
ignorant as you, as all others who accused
me. When that whirlwind of
slander overwhelmed me I told her
only what I made known to the woman
who was my betrothed. When with
tears streaming over her face she took
me in her arms and asked: &#39;My boy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
are you guilty?&#39; I could say only that
I was entirely innocent, but bound by
a solemn oath never to betray facts
committed to me under seal of professional
confidence; facts that involved
two broken-hearted women and a noble
old man, my friend in fatherless, needy
boyhood whom I had sworn to shield
from disgrace and ruin. My mother
lifted my face, looked steadily into my
eyes and raised one hand: &#39;My son,
you swear to me on your honor as a
gentleman, on the honor of my boy
Royal, that this is true&mdash;that you would
be a traitor to divulge the facts proving
your innocence?&#39; She kissed me when
that oath passed my lips, and from that
hour she abstained from all questioning;
she clung tenderly to me, believing
in my innocence as she believed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
existence of her God. You had the
same assurance, all that I could honorably
give. Mother-love held through
all assaults, no link gave way;&mdash;but
yours? The chain snapped at the first
taut strain&mdash;crumbled like sand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had grown very white, and unconsciously
her fingers lifted the quivering
fiery stones that bound her throbbing
throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let the ashes of long dead injuries
rest over all that once disquieted you.
If you had only trusted me I should
have held the secret inviolate even to the
gates of death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The shameful secret was not mine
to divulge. &#39;Trusted you?&#39; I trusted
you to trust the honor of the man you
had promised to make your husband.
When on my knees I swore to you that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
my innocence, temporarily discredited,
must inevitably be established some day
by those for whose sins I was branded,
do you recollect quite all you gave me
in return? That thirteenth of July
you hurled my ring at my feet, denounced
me as a despicable hypocrite&mdash;as
a leper unfit to defile your presence;
you denied me even the right of acquaintanceship,
vehemently forbade the
privilege of recognizing you by word
or sign. Even then I partly forgave
your frantic, passionately bitter accusation,
because I realized how revolting
to your pure, womanly instincts was
the grievous slander. You cast me out
of your life as a disgraced villain who
had forfeited all right to associate with
gentlemen. No alternative was mine;
I submitted to your cruel edict. Very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
soon the pall that seemed to blot out
all hope for me, was suddenly and
strangely lifted by that tragic deathbed
revelation which cleared me of all
blame, and left no shadow to sully my
name. I stepped back to the plane of
honorable manhood. Since the day of
that complete vindication, twelve long
years have passed. I waited, not patiently,
but I waited watching for some
message, some signal from the woman
who had promised to become my wife,
and who owed me a renewal of confidence.
Knowing me innocent you have
elected to keep me under ban.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The concentrated bitterness of his
deliberately uttered indictment, and the
merciless searchlight in his eyes had no
power to shiver the pallid rigidity of
the face proudly uplifted.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
&quot;Having forfeited all claim to your
kind or friendly remembrance, how
could you, who know my nature, expect
me to invite intolerable humiliation
from your rejection of any overture
I offered that involved confession of
wrong? I had no right to assume that
a message from me would be acceptable,
and as far as I knew, your life was so
serene and satisfying that any echo
thirteen years old would prove only an
intrusive discord. Our alienation was
complete and you carefully shunned
any opportunity to end it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had you allowed me the liberty of
approach? I obeyed your command, I
followed the line you dictated, I rigidly
refrained from word or letter and I
accorded you the silence you demanded.
My mother urged me to venture some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
overture for reconciliation, and just before
her death I found a letter she had
addressed to you in my behalf. Self-respect
forced me to expostulate, and
at her bedside I burned that letter. At
least I am entitled to your thanks that
in no degree have I attempted to invade
the territory, from which I was so ignominiously
ejected.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In saying good-night, and also an
eternal good-bye, I beg your Excellency&#39;s
acceptance of my thorough appreciation
of, and thanks for your
courteous and consistent compliance
with my wishes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned away quickly, but his
hand fell upon her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Devota! Devota!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Governor Armitage exceeds even
his official rights, and usurps a privilege
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
I grant no man. Do not touch
me.</p>

<p class="indent">He shook her gently as one might a
wayward child, and her haughty repose
could no longer defy the tender, glowing
eyes so close to her own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much longer do you intend
to impale us both on the iron cross of
your cruel, despotic pride? Since the
responsibility for our meeting here is
yours, not mine, I will speak at last,
and you shall listen. For a time, after
you forsook me, I bore up bravely, sustained
by the belief that my banishment
was temporary, because I felt assured
that vindication, though tardy, was inevitable.
Sooner than I dared to hope
that woful tragedy removed all suspicion
from me, lifted me back at once
to the position of which my slanderers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
had robbed me, and I exulted in the
anticipation of our speedy reunion;
watched the hour of every mail delivery.
After you went abroad the second
time I realized that my doom was permanent,
that your proud obstinacy
would prevent you from ever lifting a
finger to recall me, and then I grew
desperately bitter. About six years ago
I was tempted to find some relief by
a change of conditions that were reducing
me to callous cynicism. I set
to work diligently to cultivate an affection
for a very lovely woman I
thought it possible I might win by persistent
devotion. I longed to forget,
to supplant you, to cast you out of my
life as completely as you had exiled me;
but despite all efforts when I tried to
picture her as mistress of my home, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
sharing my name, my heart revolted.
Your haunting face rose before me,
your dear, beautiful hands seemed to
steal into mine as in the days when they
belonged to me. I abandoned such
futile struggles and accepted the lonely
lot that could not be averted. So long
as you remained Miss Lindsay I had
the right to recall all that was so precious
thirteen years ago. Then came
the supreme trial; it was the general
opinion of your social world that Kingdon
had won his suit, and that the day
of his marriage was not distant. I
knew he was worthy, was the most admired
and envied man in our State, and
it seemed incredible you should not accept
the glittering future he offered.
You cannot realize the maddening torture
that seizes a man, when he thinks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
that the one woman in all the world
who holds his heart in the hollow of her
hand will be clasped in the arms of another
entitled to call her his wife! So
keen was my suffering that I think the
damned would not have changed places
with me. Then Kingdon suddenly altered
the date of sailing, and in bidding
me good-bye told me you had twice rejected
him. Business had called me to
your city, and after his farewell visit
that night I could not bear the noise
and bustle of the hotel. I walked about
the parks and up and down the streets,
and though the sleet was falling I wandered
to the avenue where your great
stone house towers above all others.
Standing on the pavement in front I
listened to the city clock clanging two
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> A light shone from an upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
window; elsewhere all was dark. Only
granite walls shut me from sight of one
whose precious lips had felt the touch
of mine. As I stood in the pelting
sleet, over the silence of the night I
heard a sound that seemed to come
from the opening heavens. An organ
roll thrilling that &#39;Adagio&#39; no fingers
but yours had ever adequately interpreted
to me. Our Adagio&mdash;yours and
mine&mdash;sanctified by blessed associations
with the hallowed days of our betrothal.
As I listened, the dreary lost years
rolled away as a black curtain, and in
the limelight of memory I saw again
all our surroundings on that last happy
evening when you played for me; the
misty purple of mountain heights, the
ferny gorges where scarlet rhododendrons
flared their torches, the clustering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
honeysuckle whose chalices swung
in the breeze, and you&mdash;my promised
bride&mdash;seated at the piano, the sunset
glow burnishing your hair, your white
dress and floating blue ribbons. I
knew your touch; the passionately tender,
closing chords drifted like a whisper
from our past, like an answer from
your soul to the call of mine, and it
told me why Kingdon could never
claim you. Ah! tears gathered, dripped;
happy tears. I knew then you could
not forget, and since that night I have
found grim comfort in the belief that
only your inexorable, merciless pride
stood between us. Sweetheart of my
young manhood, darling of my lonely,
weary old heart, will you crucify us
both until death ends all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had withdrawn from his detaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
hand, shrinking back to the support
of the dial, but the surging torrent of
his words stirred frozen depths never
before beyond control. Tears glittered
in her eyes, and her lips fluttered like
wind-swept rose leaves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You believe my pride separates us
now? No, no; not pride. Can&#39;t you
understand that my bitter humiliation
is the barrier that shuts me out? The
lofty distinction you have attained is
the dividing wall I could never scale.
In the dark days of calumny I forsook
you; when most you needed loyalty I
refused to share your disgrace. Now,
as the popular idol, at whose feet the
noblest public tributes are laid, you
must accept my confession that I am
not worthy to share your honors. I
was weighed in the balance and found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
wofully wanting. The verdict of the
scales thirteen years ago cannot be reversed
by an eternity of regrets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, hush! we bury the past.
Twice at the polls the people gave me
their confidence, and gratefully I hold
the solemn responsibility as a precious
trust to be sacredly guarded, but public
applause is starving diet to a hungry
heart. My darling, between you and
me remains no question of confession
or absolution, and to-night blots out
those terribly bitter years. It is my
right to readjust the balance; in one
scale I lay all civic honors, the other
holds my life-long Sweetheart outweighing
every other earthly treasure.
I ask at your hands the one blessing
lacking in my career. Give me, oh,
give me at last the only real crown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
that can glorify a man&#39;s life&mdash;the tender
love of a faithful, pure wife! I
will no longer be denied.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stepped closer, took her cold,
quivering hands in his warm palms, and
she hid her face against his arm.</p>
